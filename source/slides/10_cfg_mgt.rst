Configuration Management History & Basics
=========================================

Configuration Management
------------------------

What is it?

    *"Configuration management is the process of standardizing resource
    configurations and enforcing their state across IT infrastructure in an
    automated yet agile manner."* [PuppetLabs]

.. [PuppetLabs] http://puppetlabs.com/solutions/configuration-management

History of CM
-------------

- mid-1990s -- "snowflake system"; few systems
- Rise of Unix-like systems and commodity x86 hardware increased the need
- CFEngine -- First release 1993; v2 released in 2002
- mid-2000s through present

  - More agile CM systems emerged developed with the cloud in mind

- 2008

  - provisioning and management of individual systems were well-understood

Infrastructure as code
----------------------

- CM enables ops to define their infrastructure in *code*
- Install packages, configure software, start/stop services
- Ensure a state of a machine
- Ensure policies and standards are in place
- Provide history of changes for a system
- Repeatable way of rebuild a system
- Orchestrate a cluster of services together

CM Platforms
------------

- CFengine

  - Lightweight agent system. Manages configuration of a large number of
    computers using the client–server paradigm or stand-alone.

- Puppet

  - Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system
    configuration, distributed using the client–server paradigm.

CM Platforms (part 2)
---------------------

- Chef

  - Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby, and uses a pure
    Ruby DSL for writing configuration "recipes". Also a client-server model.

- Ansible

  - Combines multi-node deployment, ad-hoc task execution, and configuration
    management in one package. Utilizes SSH with little to no remote agents.

Puppet Example
--------------

- Install apache and start the service
- Puppet Domain Specific Language (DSL)

.. code-block:: puppet

  package { "apache":
    name    => "httpd",
    ensure  => present,
  }

  service { "apache":
    name    => "apache",
    ensure  => running,
    enable  => true,
    require => Package["apache"],
  }

Chef Example
------------

- Install apache and start the service
- Ruby code

.. code-block:: ruby

  package "apache" do
    package_name "httpd"
    action :install
  end

  service "apache" do
    action [:enable, :start]
  end

CM Platform Comparison
----------------------

- CFEngine scales like mad, not very agile
- Puppet

  - Uses a list of dependencies and figures out what order to run it in
  - The Puppet DSL can become a blocker and a problem, puppet also has scaling
    issues

- Chef

  - Executes commands and scripts as they are listed with minimal amount of
    dependencies
  - Using ruby offers both its advantages and disadvantages

- Each platform offers its own level of complexity

Tools @ Squishy
---------------

* GitLab & GitLab CI - http://gitlab.com
* Puppet - http://puppetlabs.com
* Vagrant - http://vagrantup.com

Workflow @ Squishy
------------------

* Clone & create new branch
* Develop & test locally using Vagrant (if needed)
* Push to GitLab & create merge (pull) request to master

  - CI runs all tests in the tests directory on every push

* Code review by another team member, approve merge/pull request
* Push to master with all tests passsing triggers a deploy to staging via bin/deploy.sh
* Deployment to production is currently manual

What works?  What doesn't?
--------------------------

* Puppet & Vagrant
* Code review
* CI & Drupal
